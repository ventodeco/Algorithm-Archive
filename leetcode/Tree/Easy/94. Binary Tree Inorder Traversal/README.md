# Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

Link Problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/

The inorder tree traversal of binary tree is also known as the LNR traversal, because in this traversal, we first visit the left node (abbreviation L), followed by the root node(abbreviation N), and finally the right node (abbreviation R) of the tree.
